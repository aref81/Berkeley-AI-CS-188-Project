### [Project 1: Search](https://github.com/aref81/Berkeley-AI-CS-188-Project/tree/master/Phase-1-search)

Implementation of DFS (Depth First Search), BFS (Breadth First Search), UCS (Uniform Cost Search) and A* search with differente heuristics.
this search algorithms are used for pacman path-finding problem.
